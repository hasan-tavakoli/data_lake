# Data Lake Approach and Structure

This section outlines the approach to managing data using a Data Lake, including the principles behind its implementation and the organizational structure of data zones within the lake.

## Approach to a Data Lake

A Data Lake is designed to handle large volumes of data and support both near-real-time and batch operations. Key principles include:

- **Flexibility**: Data Lakes allow the ingestion, exploration, analysis, and reporting of all types of data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) with minimal lag.
- **Use Case Driven Processing**: Processing is driven by specific use cases to make data available to end-users as soon as possible.
- **Data Ingestion and Analysis**:
  - Create specific ingestion and analysis jobs tailored for near-real-time or batch processing.
  - Enable the ingestion, processing, and analysis of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
  - Facilitate exploratory data analysis and self-service data consumption.

## Data Zones

Data zones in a Data Lake provide logical areas for access control and organization of data tables. Each zone is created under the “Data Lake (Project Name)” directory, which is mounted on the BigQuery storage point. The following datasets are created within the Data Lake:

1. **Raw Data Zone**:
   - **Purpose**: To maintain copies or replicas of raw data ingested into the Data Lake. This zone retains raw data for a specified period to support reprocessing, data science tasks, re-ingestion with new structures, or auditing and debugging.
   - **Directory Structure**: 
     - Data is organized by the date of collection or processing, typically named in the `YYYYMMDD` format. This date directory contains the successfully collected files.

2. **Trusted Data Zone**:
   - **Purpose**: To hold raw data that has been processed and normalized. Data ingested into this zone has been validated to ensure quality.
   - **Directory Structure**: 
     - Typical structure includes subject area directories and date directories.
     - The data in this zone is ready for further analysis and reporting.

3. **Processed Data Zone**:
   - **Purpose**: To store the output of data wrangling and analytics tasks. This includes summaries, features, aggregates, and data generated by various analytics models and algorithms.
   - **Directory Structure**: 
     - Organized by subject areas and includes directories for various types of processed data.

## Summary

- **Raw Data Zone**: Retains raw data for reprocessing and auditing.
- **Trusted Data Zone**: Contains validated and processed data.
- **Processed Data Zone**: Stores results of data wrangling and analytics tasks.

By following this structure, the Data Lake efficiently manages and organizes large volumes of data, ensuring it is accessible and usable for various business needs and analytics purposes.
